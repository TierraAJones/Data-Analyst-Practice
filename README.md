# Data-Analyst-Practice
This repo contains exercise files and templates I worked on while taking a data analyst course on Udemy through IBM SkillsBuild. I took this course to learn how to code in Python and practice by using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code. While taking this course, I also learned new skills such as Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, and Seaborn. I decided to start learning these new skills earlier this year after completing a micro-internship in Winter 2023.
